## Introduction

### Project Overview
The Petclinic application is a sample Spring Boot application designed to demonstrate the capabilities of the Spring framework. I'am going to design and implement a robust CI/CD pipeline to automate the build, test and deployment of the application.

### Purpose of the CI/CD Pipeline
The CI/CD pipeline for the Petclinic application is designed to automate the processes of building, testing, and deploying the application, leading to faster and more reliable software delivery.

## Pipeline Architecture

### High-Level Architecture
![Pipeline Diagram](path/to/diagram.png)
This high-level architecture provides an overview of the stages involved in the pipeline, from source control integration to deployment, with considerations for testing, security, and monitoring at each step.

### Tools and Technologies
- **Git:** Widely used distributed version control system for tracking changes in source code files.
- **Jenkins:** Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) automation server, allowing for the automation of building, testing, and deploying software.
- **SonarQube:** Code quality and security analysis tool that identifies issues such as bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells in codebases.
- **Nexus:** Repository manager for storing and managing binary components such as Docker images, JAR files, and other artifacts.
- **Docker:** Platform for developing, shipping, and running applications using containerization, ensuring consistency across different environments.
- **Kubernetes:** Container orchestration platform for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
- **Helm:** Kubernetes package manager simplifying the deployment and management of applications on Kubernetes clusters through reusable templates called charts.
